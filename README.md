# Lollipop Church
Lollipop Church is an Esoteric programming language, designed and developed by [Shakila Tayefeh](https://github.com/shakil-t) on April 7, 2019. This programming language in which programs look like a Russian guidebook is written in Python.\
The name of this programming language is obtained from the most iconic symbol of Russia, St. Basil's Cathedral. The fact that the architecture and colors of this church prompt a lollipop, has been an inspiration for the developer.\
In Lollipop Church almost every keyword not only represents a Russian place, story, etc. but also is tailored to its concept. Shall we go through the structures?
- Comment:\
Single-line comments are created by beginning a line with “Samovar” followed by a colon.\
```Samovar: Lollipop Church```\
In case you are tired of coding, you may take a break and enjoy a cup of tea made by samovar.\
Talking about Russia may not be possible without mentioning ballet. Originated in Italy and France, ballet has a special place in the hearts of most Russians. If you would like to explain things in more detail, you might want to create a multiline comment simply by writing Ballet and putting your comment in double quotations.\
```Ballet " Lollipop Church is an Esoteric
  programming language "```
- Output:\
As a programmer, you are able to print whatever you wish by using the function of FinlandGulf ( ). Please note that you can not print more than one variable or result of operation each time. This keyword illustrates the Gulf of Finland as an external gate.
-Input:\
To get a variable input use the PalaceBridge() function. Considering the fact that Saint Petersburg is the Russian Venice, there are more than 342 bridges in the city to let through cargo river ships going along the Neva River to the Gulf of Finland. Palace Bridge is undoubtedly one of the most famous of them connecting Palace Square, home to the Winter Palace, the Hermitage Museum, and numerous historic attractions on Vasilevskiy Ostrov with the other side. The act of getting input is similar to the act of opening the bridges and letting the ships pass the gate.

•	Basic Operators

  o	Addition
  
    To add two numbers such as x and y simply type Kievskaya [ x, y ]. Kievskaya metro station is dedicated to the friendship between Russian and Ukrainian people and is named after the capital city of Ukraine.
    A symbol of the union of two nations, Kievskaya is also the addition keyword in Lollipop Church which unites two numbers together.

  o	Subtraction
  
    To subtract two numbers such as x and y type Novodevichy [ x, y ]. Novodevichy Cemetery is the home to some of the most notable graves such as Chekhov and Gogol. It is designated as the subtraction keyword since it evokes a loss.

  o	Multiplication
  
    To multiply two numbers such as x and y simply type ScarletSails [ x, y ]. Have you read the “Scarlet Sails” novel by Alexander         Grin? The story takes place in a small fishing village where Assol the daughter of a former seaman runs into an old man who claims to be a wizard and promises the girl that one day a prince will come on a ship with scarlet sails to carry her away. The villagers tease her but Assol believes her dream will eventually come true. Arthur Grey the captain of a merchant’s vessel spies Assol sleeping in the forest and falls in love with her. After learning of Assol’s dream he sets about to make it come true. Since love is the multiplication of patience and belief ScarletSails is the multiplication keyword in Lollipop Church. This keyword was suggested by Mehrnaz Ansari. 

   o	Division 
   
    To divide a number such as x by another one such as y simply type Matryoshka [ x, y].

  o	Power
  
    To raise a number such as x to the power of an exponent such as y simply type Peterhof [ x, y ]. Owing to the fact that Peterhof was commissioned by Peter the Great to show power as a direct response to the Palace of Versailles it is the power keyword.

  o	Quotient
  
    To find the quotient of a division simply type MoscowRiver [ x, y].

  o	Remainder
  
    To find the remainder of a division simply type NevaRiver [ x, y ].

  o	<
  
    Yakutsk [ x, y ] returns true if x is less than y.

  o	>
  
    SparrowHills [ x, y ] returns true if x is greater than y.

  o	<=
  
    Caspian sea [ x , y ] returns true if x is less than or equal to y.

  o	>=
  
    Elbrus [ x , y ] returns true if x is greater than or equal to y.

  o	==
  
    StIsaacCatherdal [ x , y ] returns true if x and y are equal. 

  o	!=
  
    SpilledBlood [ x , y ] returns true if x and y are not equal.

  o	AND
  
    GorkyPark [ x , y ] returns true if both x and are true.

  o	OR
  
    Gum [ x , y ]  returns true if either of x or y is true.

•	Variable

  Note that variable names must start with a lower case letter.
  o	Integer
    To define an integer like x=7 simply PeacockClock x ~ 7.

  o	Float
  
    To define a float like y=-85.126 simply type PazyrykCarpet y ~ -85.126.

  o	String 
  
    To define a string simply type AmberRoom s ~ ‘ Shakila ‘. If you would like to define an empty string just leave two quotations ‘ ‘.

•	Array 

  To define an array like b use the structure below:
  Hermitage b ( 0 ) ~ PalaceBridge ( )
  Hermitage b ( 1 ) ~ 12.962
  Hermitage b ( 2 ) ~ Matryoshka [ 49 , 7 ]

•	Loop

  To define a loop use the structure below:
  RedSquare « 
  Statement »
  AlexanderGarden ( Condition )
  The structure illustrates the march of soldiers from Red Square to the Tomb of The Unknown Soldier in Alexander Garden, Moscow which occurs every two hours and properly suits the concept of loops.

•	Condition

  Use the structure below to check if a condition is true or not:
  VictoryPark ( Condition ) «

Up to now a lexical analyzer and a parser has been developed for Lollipop Church and soon you will be able to code in this programming language. For further information or any suggestion email me at shakila.tayefe@yahoo.com.
